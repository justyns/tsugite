# Enhanced Chat Mode Features

## Overview

The chat mode has been enhanced to provide detailed visibility into agent execution, showing tool calls, code execution, and results directly in the conversation history.

## New Features

### 1. Execution Details Display

The chat interface now shows:

- **ðŸ”§ Tool calls**: When the agent uses tools (e.g., read_file, write_file, shell)
- **âš¡ Code execution**: When the agent runs Python code
- **ðŸ“¤ Execution results**: Output from code execution
- **ðŸ’¡ Observations**: Information gathered from tool results

### 2. Enhanced Message Types

New message types in the conversation flow:

```
You: What time would it be 8.2 days from now?

ðŸ”§ Tool: shell
âš¡ Code: from datetime import datetime, timedelta; now = datetime.now(); future = now + timedelta(days=8.2)
ðŸ“¤ Result: 2025-10-20 09:56:56

Agent: [Step] To calculate the time 8.2 days from now...
Agent: 2025-10-20 09:56:56
```

### 3. Configurable Visibility

- **Default**: Execution details are shown by default
- **Toggle command**: Use `/toggle` to hide/show execution details
- **Per-session**: Settings persist for the chat session

### 4. New Commands

- `/toggle` - Toggle execution details visibility
- `/help` - Updated to show new features

## Implementation Details

### Modified Files

1. **`tsugite/ui/widgets/message_list.py`**
   - Added support for new message types: `tool_call`, `code_execution`, `execution_result`, `observation`
   - Enhanced message rendering with appropriate colors and icons

2. **`tsugite/ui/textual_handler.py`**
   - Added `on_execution_event` callback for chat integration
   - Enhanced event handlers to capture and format execution details
   - Added execution result parsing

3. **`tsugite/ui/textual_chat.py`**
   - Added `show_execution_details` configuration option
   - Implemented execution event handling and message integration
   - Added `/toggle` command for runtime configuration
   - Enhanced help system

### Event Flow

1. Agent executes â†’ UI events fired (TOOL_CALL, CODE_EXECUTION, etc.)
2. TextualUIHandler captures events â†’ Formats for chat display
3. ChatApp receives formatted events â†’ Adds to message list
4. User sees execution details in conversation history

## Benefits

- **Transparency**: Users can see exactly what the agent is doing
- **Debugging**: Easier to understand agent behavior and troubleshoot issues  
- **Learning**: Users can learn from seeing the agent's tool usage patterns
- **Control**: Users can toggle visibility based on preference

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing functionality preserved
- Execution details are additive - they don't change core chat behavior
- Can be disabled via `/toggle` command for users who prefer minimal output
